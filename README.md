# Nonlinearflow
- [] check the tanh will make the boundary more smooth.
  - [] plot the networks' output before the activation of tanh.
- [] run linearflow baseline
# Improve Cellpose From the Machine Learning Perspective
- [] curriculum learning (continue learning)
- [] continuity of cell flow can be used as contrastive learning
- [] training non linear flow and cell prob simutaniously will cause inferior flow performance (multi-task)
